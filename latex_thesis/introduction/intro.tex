\textbf{NOTATION:} we use a system of geometrized units $G=c=1$.\\
Greek letters for summing over all the indeces from 0 up to 3.
Latin letters summing only on the spatial indeces 1 2 and 3.
Sometimes we use boldface to denote the spatial vectors $\vb{x} =(x,y,z)$ and we rewrtie the four-vectors as 
\[
x^{\sigma} = (x^{0},x^{1}, x^{2},x^{3}) = (t,\vb{x}) = (t,x,y,z)
\]
