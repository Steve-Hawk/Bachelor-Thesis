I wish to acknowledge the help received from some people and organizations during the developing of this project.\\
First and foremost, i must thank my supervisor, prof. Bruno Giacomazzo, who introduced me to the fascinating world of numerical relativity through the Einstein Toolkit. \\
I would also like to acknowledge the computational physics group at the University of Oslo, for providing me the access to the cluster "Smaug". 
Without the compuational power of "Smaug", I would have not run the numerical simulations shown in this work.\\
I would also like to thank Giovanni Pederiva, who constantly taught me many crucial numerical concepts.\\
Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my family, my girlfriend and my friends for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement.
This accomplishment would not have been possible without them.\\
Thank you.\\
