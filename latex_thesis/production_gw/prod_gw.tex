We have studied how the gravitational waves propagate in vacuum. 
We now want to understand the relation between the gravitational waves and their source. In most of the physical scenarios the system that produces the gravitational waves is small compared to the distances with the detector. Therefore,
In order to study the solutions of the linearized Einstein's field equation(\ref{linear_einstein_eq})
we make a crucial approximation
